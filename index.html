        <p class="lead mb-4"> My name is Roberto Orellana and I am from Los Angeles. To be exact I am from the San Fernando Valley. Growing up I was taught to go to school and get a good education in order to make a good living in the future. I want to be able to provide for my family and retire my parents. Overall I want to network and get my degree while I am attending university. I aim to being responsible with my actions in these four years and also balancing out my classes. I also want to see if I can minor in Political Science so I can know my way around domestic and international laws. Studying a bit of law will solidify the grounds of my future career in government so I know how a variety of things work.<br><br>

        My current professional experience consists from a variety of different skill sets and jobs. I am dedicated to the job no matter how big or small it is. I believe it is important to treat all professional experience as something to take seriously and held at a high standard. I am on track to get my degree in Psychology. The reason for this is because I want to study how people think and why they do the things they do in order to understand criminals. My ultimate goal is to work for the federal government and bring justice to society. Ever since I was little I have always wanted to work in some line of work that has to do with investigations. Not only that but when I need to do an investigation of my own for some reason I always know where and how to look. <br><br>

        I have a couple of hobbies that I do like partake in. One of my favorite hobbies is sleeping. I feel as if sleeping and giving your body and mind good rest is essential to do your daily tasks the next day. Another hobby I have is graffiti art. Whether that be using spray paint on a blank wall or markers in my blackbook. Graffiti is a way I can unwind and relax after a day or a couple of days that have been filled with stress. My last hobby I have is making money. I love making money because of the financial security and happiness it brings me. A sort of weird hobby that I also have is staying home when I have nothing to do. I always prefer that instead of going and partying. Last but not least, a hobby I have is learning overall. I am always intrigued by new things that I am not aware of and have a huge ambition to learn anything that peaks my interest. The way I think about it is you never know when the knowledge may useful down the line.
